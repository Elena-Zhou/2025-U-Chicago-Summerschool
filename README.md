## Topic: The Change of the Relationship Between Household Size and Employment Status During the COVID-19 Economic Shock
### Key findings:
- Before the pandemic, larger households faced significant disadvantages in unemployment and labor force withdrawal compared to 1-person house holds.
- The pandemic universally worsened adverse employment outcomes, and a key finding is that the crisis narrowed these household size-based gaps.
- Negative interactionterms indicate that larger households’ pre-pandemic disadvantages diminished, possibly due to the rise of remote work and intra-household resource pooling.
